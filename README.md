# sequoiagrove2
Hourly Employee Weekly Schedule Writing Tool. This is a rewrite of https://github.com/bethgrace5/sequoia-grove using a Microsoft focused stack, a domain driven design development strategy and various business logic improvements like support for multiple time zones. The previous project was more front end focused so that the front end did most of the calculations and the back end was simply a way to get data. It did not have any sort of logging, was difficult to setup, and had no design strategy.

This project is and will always remain free and open source. Anyone that has the ability to set it up to be hosted somewhere with their own database can use it.

Future Considerations:
When an Minimum Viable Product is ready, I (the repository holder) might offer hosting, setup, and possibly feature request or bugfix request services for a small undetermined charge. The only person that can charge for the listed services is me, and I will outline more details per service when an MVP is out.
